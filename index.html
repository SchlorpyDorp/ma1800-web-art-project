    <h1>Pain Is Your Most Valuable Teacher</h1>

    <p>
      This small website is about how the internet teaches you in the
      most annoying way possible: by hurting you first.
    </p>

    <p>
      You click the shiny thing, you get trolled, you feel stupid,
      and then you start to recognise the pattern. The trolls repeat.
      The scams repeat. The tricks repeat. That repetition
      <strong>is the lesson</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="small-text">
      The sentence guiding this project is:
      <strong>"Pain is your most valuable teacher."</strong>
      Not because pain is kind, but because it is very clear.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the next pages, you will see simple choices. Some are calm,
      slightly boring, and safe. Others are loud, rushed and fake.
      If you keep choosing the safe ones, you'll reach the end.
      If you touch the trolls, you get punished and kicked out.
    </p>

    <p class="small-text">
      Just like the real internet, but with fewer terms and conditions.
    </p>
