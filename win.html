    <h1>You Dodged The Trolls</h1>

    <p>
      You made it through without clicking the bait.
      That means you recognised something important:
      the patterns in how you are tricked.
    </p>

    <p class="small-text">
      In real life, the trolls are not this obvious.
      They look like urgent emails, fake warnings, exhausting drama,
      or "too good to be true" offers. You usually only learn
      after it hurts a few times.

    <p class="mantra">
      <strong>Pain is your most valuable teacher.</strong><br>
      It is not gentle, but it is clear.
