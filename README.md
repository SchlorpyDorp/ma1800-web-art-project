## Project Overview: “Pain Is Your Most Valuable Teacher”

This project is a small interactive site that plays on the idea that people usually learn more through mistakes and humiliation and frustration as opposed to proper tutorials and friendly instructions.
The internet is no stranger to traps: fake urgency, sketchy pop-ups, "free" offers, emotional bait, and click-me chaos. Most learn to avoid these things after falling for them at one point in their lives.

The site exaggerates the experience by making it a simple multi-page challenge
On 10 different levels, the user has to select between real links and troll links. When a troll is clicked, they are immediately directed to a punishment page (With eye-sore visuals). It's only through repeated clicking of the boring, unexciting, calm alternative that the user is given that they finally reach the end.

The core message is clear:
Pain is your most valuable teacher. Not because pain is kind, but because it’s honest.


## Context & Functionality

- The project is essentially a metaphor for online behaviour and digital literacy.
- Each level contains four choices:
  - One "safe" option that lets the user pass.
  - Three troll options that punish and reset them all the way to the very beginning.
  - Progression is done through separate HTML pages.
  - A single looping scam-style GIF appears on every page, acting like a visual parasite that follows the user around.
  - The user’s journey repeats until they adapt and recognise patterns in the scams, bait wording, emotional manipulation, and fake urgency.


## Challenges Encountered

- Working with HTML meant the logic had to be handled with manual page-links. This led to creating 10 separate level pages, each wired to the next.
- Designing the punishment page so it felt "painful" but not completely unusable required tweaking colours, and CSS animations.


## Influential Case Studies from Seminars

Two key examples of early web art shaped the general idea of this project:

### JODI.org

Jodi revealed the possibilities of meaningfully breaking the web by using glitch-driven aesthetics that was chaotic in its own way. Glitch-driven websites' application of disorientation, malfunction and visual instability impacted my choice to go more towards discomfort and flashing effects. Their work led me to understand that confusion can be used as a medium in a way.

### Superbad.com (Ben Benjamin, 1997)

The maze-like approach of Superbad lead to me wanting to make the project a micro-sized digital puzzle. My multiple level format was directly inspured by the experience of clicking through a sequence of bizarre pages with no clear understanding of where any particular link will take me in Superbad.com. Its playful uncertainty encouraged me to make navigation an element of the art in my project instead of just being a functionality.

These two case studies together formed the general idea of my web art project project: A deliberately disorienting experience of exploration where the structure of the web becomes part of the message.


## Future Extensions

If given more time or resources, I would expand the project by:

### Adding JavaScript logic
To make the trolls randomised and dynamic instead of tied to static HTML pages.

### Introducing “fake system messages”
Such as CSS-only pop-ups or pseudo-error boxes appearing mid-interaction.

### Making a difficulty curve
Where the wording of trolls becomes harder to distinguish from real options over some time.

### Tracking user behaviour
To measure how many times they fall for trolls before learning.

### Audio immersion
Such as glitch sounds or buzzing warnings — but only if the project benefits from it, not just for noise.

### Accessibility improvements
To ensure the purposefully painful visuals don’t exclude people prone to epileptic seizures.
